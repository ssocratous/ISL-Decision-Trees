First, you notice that the dataset is very small, with only 116 instances. This poses several challenges, because the decision trees might overfit the data, or our predictive model might not be the best, due to the lack of other observations. Yet, it is a good proof-of-concept that might demonstrate a real potential of predicting breast cancer from a simple blood test.

The dataset contains only the following ten attributes:

Age: age of the patient (years)
BMI: body mass index (kg/m²)
Glucose: glucose concentration in blood (mg/dL)
Insulin: insulin concentration in blood (microU/mL)
HOMA: Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (glucose multiplied by insulin)
Leptin: concentration of leptin — the hormone of energy expenditure (ng/mL)
Adiponectin: concentration of adiponectin — a protein regulating glucose levels (micro g/mL)
Resistin: concentration of resistin — a protein secreted by adipose tissue (ng/mL)
MCP.1: concentration of MCP-1 — a protein that recruits monocytes to the sites of inflammation due to tissue injury or inflammation (pg/dL)
Classification: Healthy controls (1) or patient (2)
